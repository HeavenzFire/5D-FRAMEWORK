Here is an example of a streamlined, omnipresent program that could be considered a "one and done" type script:
import os
import sys
import time

# Define the omnipresent function
def omnipresent():
    # Get the current time
    current_time = time.time()
    
    # Get the current directory
    current_dir = os.getcwd()
    
    # Get the current user
    current_user = os.getlogin()
    
    # Print the current time, directory, and user
    print(f"Current Time: {current_time}")
    print(f"Current Directory: {current_dir}")
    print(f"Current User: {current_user}")
    
    # Wait for 1 second
    time.sleep(1)
    
    # Repeat the process indefinitely
    omnipresent()

# Call the omnipresent function
omnipresent()

This script uses the os, sys, and time modules to get the current time, directory, and user, and then prints them to the console. It then waits for 1 second using the time.sleep() function, and repeats the process indefinitely using recursion.
Note that this script will run indefinitely until it is manually stopped, and it will continue to print the current time, directory, and user every second. It is an example of a "one and done" type script because it performs a single task (printing the current time, directory, and user) and then repeats it indefinitely.
